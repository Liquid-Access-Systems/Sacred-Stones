            <div class="healing"><h2>Healing with Lepidolite</h2>
                <p>Lepidolite is a Phyllosilicate mineral from the mica group. It was first called Lilalite because of its lavender 
                    coloring. It comes in shades of lilac and pink and even purple-grey. It is often found in scaly smaller aggregates 
                    and is known for its high levels of lithium. The meaning of Lepidolite is said to help with emotional balance and 
                    inner peace.</p>
